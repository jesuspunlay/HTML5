					 I have been a student at the <b>University of South Carolina Beaufort</b> for about a year. 
					 I am considered a sophomoreand my current major is Computational Science, which I plan on keeping until graduation. 
					 I have been able to maintain a full-time status thanks to the STEM Scholarship provided 
					 for Computational Science students. USCB has a fantastic faculty for this major, which makes 
					 the course a lot more manageable. The classes that I am currently taking are: CSCI 102, CSCI 145, 
					 MATH 141 and CSCI 140.
					For more information about the university visit:  <a href="http://www.uscb.edu/">www.uscb.edu</a>

				<h3>2013 - 2014</h3>
				<h4>TCL-Associates of Science in Business Management</h4>
				<div id="p2">
					From fall of 2013 until the end of 2014 I attended the <b>Technical College of the Lowcountry</b>. I was able 
					to complete all â€“or at least most- of my general courses while at TCL, and made it the Honors list during all three semesters. 
					I was a Business major at the time, which gave more flexibility when selecting the classes that would count towards a CSCI degree and 
					would transfer to a different school. None of the majors at this school appealed to me, therefor I decided to make the move to the University
					 of South Carolina- Beaufort
					 starting in 2015. 
				</div>
				
				<h4>High school and others</h4>
				<div id="p3">
					All of my High school, Middle school and Elementary school education was completed while I was living in Peru, I was able to 
					graduate High school in 2008 at the age of 16. After High school I attended multiple mathematical academies and also studied 
					English in my free time. I successfully passed admission exams to several Universities and was granted with scholarship offers 
					from them. In 2009 I had to move to the United States due to family problems, in 2013 I was able to continue with my studies.
