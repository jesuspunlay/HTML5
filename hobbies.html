					In my free time I usually play soccer, sign into League of Legends, or simply listen to music. 
					Soccer is a sport I have been playing ever since I was 7 years old, and I still enjoy playing it up to this day. It 
					all started playing with my cousins near my house then it escalated to playing for school. While I was In high school 
					I played pretty much every day, I even had the chance to play for the 15 or younger sub-division of one of the biggest 
					teams in my country as a defender -I was in great shape. It has been hard to find time to play soccer after I moved to 
					the States, at the moment I only play every now and then with other students at USCB.

				</p>
				<p>
					League of legends is one of the few games I play nowadays, I have been playing it for a few years now. I probably play
					 a game or two per week, which makes it challenging to keep up with people who play this game as if their lives depended 
					 on it. The Witcher 3, Battlefield 4, Batman Arkham Knight and Dying Light are some of the other games I also play.  

				</p>
				<p>
					I also love the outdoors, whenever I get a chance, I go camping with my family and friends. We enjoy spending time outside 
					hiking, grilling and relaxing around a campfire. There are other sports I like to practice such as surfing, playing pool, chess, 
					volleyball and others.
