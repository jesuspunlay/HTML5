				<h2>Life</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Jesus Punlay, and I was born on April 26th of 1992 in Lima,
					Peru. I grew up in the district of Miraflores in Lima with my grandmother.
					I spent most of my time with my cousin Israel, who I grew up with and was 
					like a brother to me. Lima is a big city, therefor there is always something
					to do. Among the things I enjoyed the most doing are surfing, playing soccer, 
					videogames and playing pool. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Surfing is huge in Lima, we are known for having some of the best waves in the world, 
					and it is safe to say that most people grow up surfing like I did. I also play soccer, 
					which is the biggest sport in Peru, I had a good time playing every day during high school. 
					As far as videogames, I play on my PC. I love putting together my own build and tuning 
					it so it fulfills my needs. 

				</p>
				<p>
					Ever since I was little I have always been a handy person, whenever I come across a problem
					 I try my best to solve it on my own before I ask for help. I believe that there are many 
					 simple tasks that everybody should know how to do, and should be part of everyone's general 
					 knowledge. Life is not easy and there is not always going to be someone around you to help.
				</p>
				<p>
					I moved to the United States when I was 17 and it was a big change for me. All the sudden I 
					knew nobody but my mother and stepfather.  It took some time before I got back in school. I 
					am currently attending USCB and will graduate in 2017 as a Computational Science major. I also
					 work full-time at Publix, which is conveniently located across the street from school. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I got married on January 3rd of 2015 to Elizabeth Punlay, and we had a son on May 22nd of the 
					same year, who we named Gabriel Punlay. He has been quite a handful and now I understand why 
					people always seem so busy after having children. They are the reason I make a lot of sacrifices 
					and they inspire me to keep moving forward.
